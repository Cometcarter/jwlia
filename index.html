            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>The Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative (WLI) was founded in 2006 by three visionary women in Boston,
                Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings emerging women
                leaders, referred to as the Fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks of hands-on experience
                and training with successful nonprofit organizations in nonprofit management and leadership development.
                During their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an Action Plan, which will serve as a step-by-step
                roadmap to make their dreams of social change a reality. After returning to Japan, the Fellows are
                expected to make a difference in their communities based on their Action Plans. The purpose of this
                program is for the fellows to share the knowledge and experience they acquired in Boston with other
                women and social sector leaders within Japan.
                The Fish Family Foundation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based nonprofit organizations, is
                administering JWLI in partnership with Simmons College School of Management's Center for Gender in
                Organizations.
                In 2010, thanks to the generous funding provided by the U.S. - Japan Foundation, JWLI expanded its
                vision to hold public forums within Japan. Held in 2010, 2012 and 2013, these public forums provided
                information about the nonprofit sector and the American approach to philanthropy with hopes to inspire
                women to take leadership roles. The Forum Program reached hundreds of Japanese citizens, advocating for
                their involvement in addressing the needs of Japanese society.</p>

                    disaster to assessed and evaluated the needs of the people and community. In the two years the fund

                    and projects working directly in Tohoku. It has been reported by the grantees that JDRFB's $1
                    million grants were leveraged to have $6 million of economic impact.</p>
